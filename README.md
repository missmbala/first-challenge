# First Challenge

## Description

This exercise is a part of the first challenge for the Bootcamp. 

Starter code was provided. It required a completion of a series of tasks, including making the website more accessible, as well as to use more semantic HTML style and ensuring that HTML follows logical structure.

This challenge helped me understand more about the relation between HMTL and CSS and allowed me to try to use it more independently. I have learnt the impoartance of debugging and troubleshooting in coding.
